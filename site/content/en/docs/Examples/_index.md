  Amazon Genomics CLI in action!
---

As part of our GitHub distribution we provide some example projects along with their workflows in the `examples/` folder.
These projects are also included in the `$HOME/agc/examples` folder that is created when you install Amazon Genomics CLI.

The `demo-project` shows some basic concepts and tests, while the `gatk-best-practices-project` provides some real world 
genetics workflows. We also include a `demo-nextflow` project to show some basic examples of running Nextflow workflows
in Amazon Genomics CLI.
