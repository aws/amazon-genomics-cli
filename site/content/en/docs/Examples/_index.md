  Amazon Genomics CLI in action!

{{% alert title="Attention" color="warning" %}}
**The Amazon Genomics CLI project has entered its End Of Life (EOL) phase**. The code is no longer actively maintained and the **Github repository will be archived on May 31 2024**. During this time, we encourage customers to migrate to [AWS HealthOmics](https://aws.amazon.com/healthomics/) to run their genomics workflows on AWS, or [reach out to their AWS account team](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/?nc2=h_header) for alternative solutions. While the source code of AGC will still be available after the EOL date, we will not make any updates inclusive of addressing issues or accepting Pull Requests.

As part of our GitHub distribution we provide some example projects along with their workflows in the `examples/` folder.
These projects are also included in the `$HOME/agc/examples` folder that is created when you install Amazon Genomics CLI.

The `demo-project` shows some basic concepts and tests, while the `gatk-best-practices-project` provides some real world 
genetics workflows. We also include a `demo-nextflow` project to show some basic examples of running Nextflow workflows
in Amazon Genomics CLI.
