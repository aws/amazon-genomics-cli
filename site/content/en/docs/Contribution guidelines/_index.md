  How to contribute to AWS Genomics CLI
---

We use Go as the main language of the AWS Genomics CLI. To interact with AWS Services we use the AWS SDK for Go v2. Infrastructure to be deployed into an AWS Account is coded as TypeScript
using the AWS CDK.

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

Please refer to our [Contributing](https://github.com/aws/amazon-genomics-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document on GitHub for specifics regarding our Pull request procedures, bug reports,
feature requests, code of conduct and license terms.
