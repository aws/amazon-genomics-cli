This project includes workflows based on [GATK Best Practices](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us), developed by 
the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/). More information on how these workflows work is available in 
the [GATK Workflows Github repository](https://github.com/gatk-workflows).
