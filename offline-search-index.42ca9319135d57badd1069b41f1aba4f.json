[{"body":"Amazon Genomics CLI requires an AWS account in which to deploy the cloud infrastructure required to run and manage workflows. To begin working with Amazon Genomics CLI and account must be “Activated” by the Amazon Genomics CLI application using the account activate command.\nWhich AWS Account is Used by Amazon Genomics CLI? Amazon Genomics CLI uses the same AWS credential chain used by the AWS CLI to determine what account should be used and with what credentials. All that is required is that you have an existing AWS account (or create a new one) which contains at least one IAM Principal (User/ Role) that you have can access.\nWhich Region is Used by Amazon Genomics CLI? Much like accounts and credentials, Amazon Genomics CLI uses the same chain used by the AWS CLI to determine the region that is being targeted. For example, if your AWS profile uses us-east-1 then Amazon Genomics CLI will use the same. Likewise, if you set the AWS_REGION environment variable to eu-west-1 then that region will be used by Amazon Genomics CLI for all subsequent commands in that shell.\nShared Infrastructure When a region is first activated for Amazon Genomics CLI, some basic infrastructure is deployed including a VPC and an S3 bucket. This core infrastructure will be shared by all Amazon Genomics CLI users and projects in that region. Note that context specific infrastructure is not shared and is unique and namespaced by user and project.\nBring your Own VPC and S3 Bucket During account activation you may specify an existing VPC ID or S3 bucket name for use by Amazon Genomics CLI. If you do not these will be created for you. Although we use AWS best practices for these, if your organization has specific security requirements for networking and storage this may be the easiest way to activate Amazon Genomics CLI in your environment.\nAccount Commands A full reference of the account commands is here\nactivate You can activate an account using agc account activate. An account must be activated before any contexts can be deployed or workflows run.\nAmazon Genomics CLI requires an S3 bucket to store workflow results and associated information. If you prefer to use an existing bucket you can use the form agc account activate --bucket my-existing-bucket. If you do this the AWS IAM role used to run Amazon Genomics CLI must be able to write to that bucket.\nTo use an existing VPC you can use the form agc account activate --vpc my-existing-vpc-id. This VPC must have at least 3 availability zones each with at least one private subnet. The private subnets must have connectivity to the internet, such as via a NAT gateway, and connectivity to AWS services either through VPC endpoints or the internet. Amazon Genomics CLI will not modify the network topology of the specified VPC.\nIssuing account activate commands more than once effectively updates the core infrastructure with the difference between the two commands. For example, if you had previously activated the account using agc account activate and later invoked agc account activate --bucket my-existing-bucket --vpc my-existing-vpc-id then Amazon Genomics CLI will update to use my-existing-bucket and the identified VPC. The old VPC and related infrastructure will be destroyed. S3 buckets will be retained according to their retention policy.\nIf you initially activated the account with agc account activate --bucket my-existing-bucket --vpc my-existing-vpc-id and later invoked agc account activate then Amazon Genomics CLI will stop using the previous specified bucket and VPC. ALL of the pre-existing S3 and VPC infrastructure will be retained and a new bucket and VPC will be created for use by Amazon Genomics CLI.\ndeactivate The deactivate command is used to remove the core infrastructure deployed by Amazon Genomics CLI in the current region when an account is activated. The S3 bucket deployed by Amazon Genomics CLI and its contents are retained. If a VPC and/ or S3 bucket were specified by the user during account activation these will also be retained. Any CloudWatch logs produced by Amazon Genomics CLI will also be retained.\nIf there are existing deployed contexts the command will fail, however, you can force the removal of these at the same time with the --force flag. Note that this will also interrupt any running workflow of any user in that region.\nThe deactivate command will only operate on infrastructure in the current region.\nIf the deployed infrastructure has been modified through the console or the AWS CLI rather than through Amazon Genomics CLI deactivation may fail due to the infrastructure state being inconsistent with the CloudFormation state. If this happens you may need to manually clean up through the CloudFormation console.\nCosts Core infrastructure deployed for Amazon Genomics CLI is tagged with the application-name: agc tag. This tag can be activated for cost tracking in AWS CostExplorer. The core infrastructure is shared and not tagged with any username, context name or project name.\nWhile an account region is activated there will be ongoing charges from the core infrastructure deployed including things such as VPC NAT gateways and VPC Endpoints. If you no longer use Amazon Genomics CLI in a region we recommend you deactivate it. You may also wish to remove the S3 bucket along with its objects as well as the CloudWatch logs produced by Amazon Genomics CLI. These are retained by default so that you can view workflow results and logs even after deactivation.\nNetwork traffic When running genomics workflows, network traffic can become a significant expense when the traffic is routed through NAT gateways into private subnets (where worker nodes are usually located). To minimize these costs we recommend the use of VPC Enpoints (see below) as well as activating Amazon Genomics CLI and running your workflows in the same region as your S3 bucket holding your genome files. VPC Gateway endpoints are regional so cross region S3 access will not be routed through a VPC gateway.\nIf you make use of large container images in your workflows (such as the GATK images) we recommend copying these to a private ECR repository in the same region that you will run your analysis to use ECR endpoints and avoid traffic through NAT gateways.\nVPC Endpoints When Amazon Genomics CLI creates a VPC it creates the following VPC endpoints:\n com.amazonaws.{region}.ecr.api com.amazonaws.{region}.ecr.dkr com.amazonaws.{region}.ecs com.amazonaws.{region}.ecs-agent com.amazonaws.{region}.ecs-telemetry com.amazonaws.{region}.logs com.amazonaws.{region}.s3  If you provide your own VPC we recommend that the VPC also has these endpoints. This will improve the security posture of Amazon Genomics CLI in your VPC and will also reduce NAT gateway traffic charges which can be substantial for genomics analyses that use large S3 objects and/ or large container images.\nTechnical Details. Amazon Genomics CLI core infrastructure is defined in code and deployed by AWS CDK. The CDK app responsible for creating the core infrastructure can be found in packages/cdk/core/.\n","categories":"","description":"How AWS Genomics CLI interacts with AWS Accounts\n","excerpt":"How AWS Genomics CLI interacts with AWS Accounts\n","ref":"/amazon-genomics-cli/docs/concepts/accounts/","tags":"","title":"Accounts"},{"body":"What is the Amazon Genomics CLI? Amazon Genomics CLI is an open source tool for genomics and life science customers that simplifies and automates the deployment of cloud infrastructure, providing you with an easy-to-use command line interface to quickly setup and run genomics workflows on Amazon Web Services (AWS) specified by languages like WDL. By removing the heavy lifting from setting up and running genomics workflows in the cloud, software developers and researchers can automatically provision, configure and scale cloud resources to enable faster and more cost-effective population-level genetics studies, drug discovery cycles, and more.\nWhy do I want it? Amazon Genomics CLI is targeted at bioinformaticians and genomics analysts who are not experts in cloud infrastructure and best practices. If you want to take advantage of cloud computing to run your workflows at scale, but you don’t want to become an expert in high performance batch computing and distributed systems then Amazon Genomics CLI is probably for you.\n  What is it good for?: Abstracting the infrastructure needed to run workflows from the running of the workflows by hiding all the complexity behind a familiar CLI interface. When you need to get your workflows running quickly and are happy to let the tool make the decisions about the best infrastructure according to AWS best practices.\n  What is it not good for?: Situations where you want, or need, complete and fine-grained control over how your workflows are run in the cloud. Where specifying exactly how they run, and what infrastructure is used, is just as important as running them.\n  What is it not yet good for?: Let us know, we’d love to hear your suggestions on how we can make the tool work for you.\n  Where should I go next?

This email should be unique to the individual user. This email address is used to determine a unique user ID which will be used to uniquely identify infrastructure belonging to that user.\nAmazon Genomics CLI Users are Not IAM Users (or Principals) Amazon Genomics CLI users are primarily used for identification and as a component of namespacing. They are not a security measure, nor are they related to IAM users or roles. All AWS activities carried out by Amazon Genomics CLI will be done using the AWS credentials in the environment where the CLI is installed and are not based on the Amazon Genomics CLI username.\nFor example. If Amazon Genomics CLI is installed on an EC2 instance and configured with the email someone@company.com Amazon Genomics CLI will interact with AWS resources based solely on the IAM Role assigned to that EC2 via it’s instance profile. Like wise if you use Amazon Genomics CLI on your laptop then the IAM role that you use will be determined by the same process as is used by the AWS CLI.\nWho am I? To find out what username and email has been configured in your current environment you can use the following command:\nagc configure describe Changing user If you update your configured email, a new user identity is generated. If this is done while infrastructure is deployed, Amazon Genomics CLI may no longer be able to identify that infrastructure as belonging to your project. We strongly recommend stopping all running workflows and destroying all your deployed contexts from all projects before changing user. If you do not do this, you or an account administrator will need to identify any un-needed infrastructure in the CloudFormation console and remove it from there.\n","categories":"","description":"How Amazon Genomics CLI identifies users\n","excerpt":"How Amazon Genomics CLI identifies users\n","ref":"/amazon-genomics-cli/docs/concepts/users/","tags":"","title":"Users"},{"body":"The following are complete worked examples made up of multiple tasks that guide the you through a relatively simple but realistic scenarios using Amazon Genomics CLI.\n","categories":"","description":"Work through some end to end examples.\n","excerpt":"Work through some end to end examples.\n","ref":"/amazon-genomics-cli/docs/tutorials/","tags":"","title":"Tutorials"},{"body":"Things to consider so that you can get the most out of Amazon Genomics CLI\n","categories":"","description":"Best practices when using Amazon Genomics CLI\n","excerpt":"Best practices when using Amazon Genomics CLI\n","ref":"/amazon-genomics-cli/docs/best-practices/","tags":"","title":"Best Practices"},{"body":"Prerequisites Ensure you have completed the prerequisites before beginning.\nDownload and install Amazon Genomics CLI Download the Amazon Genomics CLI according to the installation instructions.\nSetup Ensure you have initialized your account and created a username by following the setup instructions.\nInitialize a project Amazon Genomics CLI uses local folders and config files to define projects. Projects contain configuration settings for contexts and workflows (more on these below). To create a new project for running WDL based workflows do the following:\nmkdir myproject cd myproject agc project init myproject --workflow-type wdl  NOTE: for a Nextflow based project you can substitute --workflow-type wdl with ---workflow-type nextflow.\n Projects may have workflows from different languages, so the --workflow-type flag is simply to provide the stub for an initial workflow engine.\nThis will create a config file called agc-project.yaml with the following contents:\nname:myprojectschemaVersion:1contexts:ctx1:engines:- type:wdlengine:cromwellThis config file will be used to define aspects of the project - e.g. the contexts and named workflows the project uses. For a more representative project config, look at the projects in ~/agc/examples. Unless otherwise stated, command line activities for the remainder of this document will assume they are run from within the ~/agc/examples/demo-wdl-project/ project folder.\nContexts Amazon Genomics CLI uses a concept called “contexts” to run workflows. Contexts encapsulate and automate time-consuming tasks like configuring and deploying workflow engines, creating data access policies, and tuning compute clusters for operation at scale. In the demo-wdl-project folder, after running the following:\nagc context list You should see something like:\n2021-09-22T01:15:41Z 𝒊 Listing contexts. CONTEXTNAME myContext CONTEXTNAME spotCtx In this project there are two contexts, one configured to run with On-Demand instances (myContext), and one configured to use SPOT instances (spotCtx).\nYou need to have a context running to be able to run workflows. To deploy the context myContext in the demo-wdl-project, run:\nagc context deploy -c myContext This will take 10-15min to complete.\nIf you have more than one context configured, and want to deploy them all at once, you can run:\nagc context deploy --all Contexts have read-write access to a context specific prefix in the S3 bucket Amazon Genomics CLI creates during account activation. You can check this for the myContext context with:\nagc context describe -c myContext You should see something like:\nCONTEXT myContext false STARTED OUTPUTLOCATION s3://agc-123456789012-us-east-2/project/Demo/userid/xxxxxxxxJKP3z/context/myContext You can add more data locations using the data section of the agc-project.yaml config file. All contexts will have an appropriate access policy created for the data locations listed when they are deployed. For example, the following config adds three public buckets from the Registry of Open Data on AWS:\nname:myprojectdata:- location:s3://broad-referencesreadOnly:true- location:s3://gatk-test-datareadOnly:true- location:s3://1000genomesreadOnly:trueNote, you need to redeploy any running contexts to update their access to data locations. Do this by simply (re)running.\nagc context deploy -c myContext Contexts also define what types of compute your workflow will run on - i.e. if you want to run workflows using SPOT or On-demand instances. By default, contexts use On-demand instances. The configuration for a context that uses SPOT instances looks like the following:\ncontexts:# The spot context uses EC2 spot instances which are usually cheaper but may be interruptedspotCtx:requestSpotInstances:trueYou can also explicitly specify what instance types contexts will be able to use for workflow jobs. By default, Amazon Genomics CLI will use a select set of instance types optimized for running genomics workflow jobs that balance data I/O performance and mitigation of workflow failure due to SPOT reclamation. In short, Amazon Genomics CLI uses AWS Batch for job execution and selects instance types based on the requirements of submitted jobs, up to 4xlarge instance types. If you have a use case that requires a specific set of instance types, you can define them with something like:\ncontexts:specialCtx:instanceTypes:- c5- m5- r5The above will create a context called specialCtx that will use any size of instances in the C5, M5, and R5 instance families. Contexts are elastic with a minimum vCPU capacity of 0 and a maximum of 256. When all vCPUs are allocated to jobs, further tasks will be queued.\nContexts also launch an engine for specific workflow types. You can have one engine per context and, currently, engines for WDL and Nextflow are supported.\nA contexts configured with WDL and Nextflow engines respectively look like:\ncontexts:wdlContext:engines:- type:wdlengine:cromwellnfContext:engines:- type:nextflowengine:nextflowWorkflows Add a workflow Bioinformatics workflows are written in languages like WDL and Nextflow in either single script files, or in packages of multiple files (e.g. when there are multiple related workflows that leverage reusable elements). Currently, Amazon Genomics CLI supports both WDL and Nextflow. To learn more about WDL workflows, we suggest resources like the OpenWDL - Learn WDL course. To learn more about Nextflow workflows, we suggest Nextflow’s documentation and NF-Core.\nFor clarity, we’ll refer to these workflow script files as “workflow definitions”. A “workflow specification” for Amazon Genomics CLI references workflow definitions and combines it with additional metadata, like the workflow language the definition is written in, which Amazon Genomics CLI will use to execute it on appropriate compute resources.\nThere is a “hello” workflow definition in the ~/agc/examples/demo-wdl-project/workflows/hello folder that looks like:\nversion 1.0 workflow hello_agc { call hello {} } task hello { command { echo \"Hello Amazon Genomics CLI!\" } runtime { docker: \"ubuntu:latest\" } output { String out = read_string( stdout() ) } } The workflow specification for this workflow in the project config looks like:\nworkflows:hello:type:language:wdlversion:1.0sourceURL:workflows/hello.wdlHere the workflow is expected to conform to the WDL-1.0 specification. A specification for a “hello” workflow written in Nextflow DSL1 would look like:\nworkflows:hello:type:language:nextflowversion:1.0sourceURL:workflows/helloFor Nextflow DSL2 workflows set type.version to dsl2.\nNOTE: When referring to local workflow definitions, sourceURL must either be a full absolute path or a path relative to the agc-project.yaml file. Path expansion is currently not supported.\nYou can quickly get a list of available configured workflows with:\nagc workflow list For the demo-wdl-project, this should return something like:\n2021-09-02T05:14:47Z 𝒊 Listing workflows. WORKFLOWNAME haplotype WORKFLOWNAME hello WORKFLOWNAME read WORKFLOWNAME words-with-vowels The hello workflow specification points to a single-file workflow. Workflows can also be directories. For example, if you have a workflow that looks like:\nworkflows/hello-dir |-- inputs.json `-- main.wdl The workflow specification for the workflow above would simply point to the parent directory:\nworkflows:hello-dir-abs:type:language:wdlversion:1.0sourceURL:/abspath/to/hello-dirhello-dir-rel:type:language:wdlversion:1.0sourceURL:relpath/to/hello-dirIn this case, your workflow must be named main.\u003cworkflow-type\u003e - e.g. main.wdl\nYou can also provide a MANIFEST.json file that points to a specific workflow file to run. If you have a folder like:\nworkflows/hello-manifest/ |-- MANIFEST.json |-- hello.wdl |-- inputs.json `-- options.json The MANIFEST.json file would be:\n{ \"mainWorkflowURL\": \"hello.wdl\", \"inputFileURLs\": [ \"inputs.json\" ] } At minimum, MANIFEST files must have a mainWorkflowURL property which is a relative path to the workflow file in its parent directory.\nWorkflows can also be from remote sources like GitHub:\nworkflows:remote:type:language:wdlversion:1.0# this is the WDL spec versionsourceURL:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openwdl/learn-wdl/master/1_script_examples/1_hello_worlds/1_hello/hello.wdl NOTE: remote sourceURLs for Nextflow workflows can be Git repo URLs like: https://github.com/nextflow-io/rnaseq-nf.git\n Running a workflow To run a workflow you need a running context. See the section on contexts above if you need to start one. To run the “hello” workflow in the “myContext” context, run:\nagc workflow run hello --context myContext If you have another context in your project, for example one named “test”, you can run the “hello” workflow there with:\nagc workflow run hello --context test If your workflow was successfully submitted you should get something like:\n2021-08-04T23:01:37Z 𝒊 Running workflow. Workflow name: 'hello', Arguments: '', Context: 'myContext' \"06604478-0897-462a-9ad1-47dd5c5717ca\" The last line is the workflow run id. You use this id to reference a specific workflow execution.\nRunning workflows is an asynchronous process. After submitting a workflow from the CLI, it is handled entirely in the cloud. You can now close your terminal session if needed. The workflow will still continue to run. You can also run multiple workflows at a time. The underlying compute resources will automatically scale. Try running multiple instances of the “hello” workflow at once.\nYou can check the status of all running workflows with:\nagc workflow status You should see something like this:\nWORKFLOWINSTANCE myContext 66826672-778e-449d-8f28-2274d5b09f05 true COMPLETE 2021-09-10T21:57:37Z hello By default, the workflow status command will show the state of all workflows across all running contexts.\nTo show only the status of workflow instances of a specific workflow you can use:\nagc workflow status -n \u003cworkflow-name\u003e To show only the status of workflows instances in a specific context you can use:\nagc workflow status -c \u003ccontext-name\u003e If you want to check the status of a specific workflow you can do so by referencing the workflow execution by its run id:\nagc workflow status -r \u003cworkflow-run-id\u003e If you need to stop a running workflow instance, run:\nagc workflow stop \u003cworkflow-run-id\u003e Using workflow inputs You can provide runtime inputs to workflows at the command line. For example, the demo-wdl-project has a workflow named read that requires reading a data file. The specification of read looks like:\nversion 1.0 workflow ReadFile { input { File input_file } call read_file { input: input_file = input_file } } task read_file { input { File input_file } String content = read_string(input_file) command { echo '~{content}' } runtime { docker: \"ubuntu:latest\" memory: \"4G\" } output { String out = read_string( stdout() ) } } You can create an input file locally for this workflow:\nmkdir inputs echo \"this is some data\" \u003e inputs/data.txt cat \u003c\u003c EOF \u003e inputs/read.inputs.json {\"ReadFile.input_file\": \"data.txt\"} EOF Finally, you would submit the workflow with its corresponding inputs file with:\nagc workflow run read --args inputs/read.inputs.json Amazon Genomics CLI will scan the file provided to --args for local paths, sync those files to S3, and rewrite the inputs file in transit to point to the appropriate S3 locations. Paths in the *.inputs.json file provided as --args are referenced relative to the *.inputs.json file.\nAccessing workflow results Workflow results are written to an S3 bucket specified or created by Amazon Genomics CLI during account activation. See the section on account activation above for more details. You can list or retrieve the S3 URI for the bucket with:\nAGC_BUCKET=$(aws ssm get-parameter \\  --name /agc/_common/bucket \\  --query 'Parameter.Value' \\  --output text) and then use aws s3 commands to explore and retrieve data from the bucket. For example, to list the bucket contents:\naws s3 ls $AGC_BUCKET You should see something like:\nPRE project/ PRE scripts/ Data for multiple projects are kept in project/\u003cproject-name\u003e prefixes. Looking into one you should see:\nPRE cromwell-execution/ PRE workflow/ The cromwell-execution prefix is specific to the engine Amazon Genomics CLI uses to run WDL workflows. Workflow results will be in cromwell-execution partitioned by workflow name, workflow run id, and task name. The workflow prefix is where named workflows are cached when you run workflows definitions stored in your local environment.\nAccessing workflow logs You can get a summary of the log information for a workflow as follows:\nagc logs workflow \u003cworkflow-name\u003e This will return the logs for all runs of the workflow. If you just want the logs for a specific workflow run, you can use:\nagc logs workflow \u003cworkflow-name\u003e -r \u003cworkflow-instance-id\u003e This will print out the stdout generated by each workflow task.\nFor the hello workflow above, this would look like:\nFri, 10 Sep 2021 22:00:04 +0000 download: s3://agc-123456789012-us-east-2/scripts/3e129a27928c192b7804501aabdfc29e to tmp/tmp.BqCb2iaae/batch-file-temp Fri, 10 Sep 2021 22:00:04 +0000 *** LOCALIZING INPUTS *** Fri, 10 Sep 2021 22:00:05 +0000 download: s3://agc-123456789012-us-east-2/project/Demo/userid/xxxxxxxxJKP3z/context/myContext/cromwell-execution/hello_agc/66826672-778e-449d-8f28-2274d5b09f05/call-hello/script to agc-123456789012-us-east-2/project/Demo/userid/xxxxxxxxJKP3z/context/myContext/cromwell-execution/hello_agc/66826672-778e-449d-8f28-2274d5b09f05/call-hello/script Fri, 10 Sep 2021 22:00:05 +0000 *** COMPLETED LOCALIZATION *** Fri, 10 Sep 2021 22:00:05 +0000 Hello Amazon Genomics CLI!

Each project is defined in a project file named agc-project.yaml.\nProject File Location To find the project definition, Amazon Genomics CLI will look for a file named agc-project.yaml in the current working directory. If the file is not found, Amazon Genomics CLI will traverse up the file hierarchy until the file is found or until the root of the file system is reached. If no project definition can be found an error will be reported. All Amazon Genomics CLI commands operate on the project identified by the above process.\nConsider the example directory structure below:\n/ ├── baa/ │ ├── a/ │ └── agc-project.yaml ├── foo/ └── foz/ └── a/ ├── agc-project.yaml └── b/ └── c/ └── agc-project.yaml  If the current working directory is /baa or /baa/a then /baa/agc-project.yaml will be used for definitions, If the current working directory is /foo an error will be reported as no project file is found before the root, If the current working directory is /foz an error will be reported as no project file is found before the root, If the current working directory is /foz/a or /foz/a/b then /foz/a/agc-project.yaml will be used for definitions. If the current working directory is /foz/a/b/c then /foz/a/b/c/agc-project.yaml will be used for definitions.  Relative Locations The location of resources declared in a project file are resolved relative to the location of the project file unless they are declared using an absolute path. If the project file in /baa declared that there was a workflow definition in a/b/ then Amazon Genomics CLI will search for that definition in /baa/a/b/.\nProject File Structure A minimal project file can be generated using the agc project init myProject --workflow-type nextflow. Using myProject as a project name and workflow type nextflow will result in the following:\nname:myProjectschemaVersion:1contexts:ctx1:engines:- type:nextflowengine:nextflowThis is fully usable project called “myProject” with a single context named “ctx1”. At this point “ctx1” can be deployed however, there are currently no workflows defined.\nname A string that identifies the project\nschemaVersion An integer defining the schema version. Version numbers will be incremented when changes are made to the project schema that are not backward compatible.\ncontexts A map of context names to context definitions. Each context in the project must have a unique name. The contexts documentation provides more details.\nworkflows A map of workflow names to workflow definitions. Workflow names must be unique in a project. The workflows documentation provides more details.\ndata An array of data sources that the contexts of the project have access to. For example:\ndata:- location:s3://gatk-test-datareadOnly:true- location:s3://broad-referencesreadOnly:true- location:s3://1000genomes-dragen-3.7.6readOnly:trueCommands A full reference of project commands are available here\ninit The agc project init \u003cproject-name\u003e --workflow-type \u003cworklow-type\u003e command can be used to initialize a minimal agc-project.yaml file in the current directory. Alternatively project yaml files can be created with any text editor.\ndescribe The agc project describe \u003cproject-name\u003e command will provide basic metadata about the ‘local’ project file. See above for details on how project files are located.\nVersioning and Sharing We recommend placing a project under source version control using a tool like Git. The folder containing the agc-project.yaml file is a natural location for the root of a Git repository. Workflows relating to the project would naturally be located in sub-folders of the same repository allowing those to be versioned as well. Alternatively, more advanced Git users may consider storing workflows as a Git sub-module allowing them to be independent of the project and reused among projects.\nProjects and associated workflows can then be shared by “pushing” the project’s Git repository to a website such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket or hosted on a private Git Server like AWS Code Commit. To facilitate sharing you should ensure that any file paths in your definitions are relative to the project and not absolute. You will also need to make sure that data locations are appropriately shared.\nCosts A project itself doesn’t have infrastructure. It is not deployed and therefore has no direct costs. If the contexts defined by an infrastructure are deployed or the workflows run then those will incur costs.\nTags The project name will be tagged on any deployed contexts or workflows defined in this project allowing costs to be aggregated to the project level.\nTechnical Details A project is purely a YAML definition. The values in the agc-project.yaml file are used by CDK when Amazon Genomics CLI deploys contexts and when Amazon Genomics CLI runs workflows. The project itself has no direct infrastructure. The project name is used to help namespace context infrastructure.\n","categories":"","description":"A project defines the contexts, engines, data and workflows that make up a genomics analysis\n","excerpt":"A project defines the contexts, engines, data and workflows that make …","ref":"/amazon-genomics-cli/docs/concepts/projects/","tags":"","title":"Projects"},{"body":"We use Go as the main language of the AWS Genomics CLI.

A context is a set of cloud resources. Amazon Genomics CLI runs workflows in a context. A deployed context will include an engine that can interpret and manage the running of a workflow along with compute resources that will run the individual tasks of the workflow. The deployed context will also contain any resources needed by the engine or compute resources including any security, permissions and logging capabilities. Deployed contexts are namespaced based on the user, project and context name so that resources are isolated, preventing collisions.\nWhen a workflow is run the user will decide which context will run it. For example, you might choose to submit a workflow to a context that uses “Spot priced” resources or one that uses “On Demand” priced resources.\nWhen deployed context resources that require a VPC will be deployed into the VPC that was specified when the account was activated.\nHow is a Context Defined? A context is defined in the YAML file that defines the project. A project has at least one context but may have many. Contexts must have unique names and are defined as YAML maps.\nA context may request use of Spot priced compute resources with requestSpotInstances: true. The default value is false.\nA context must define an array of one or more engines. Each engine definition must specify the workflow language that it will interpret. For each language Amazon Genomics CLI has a default engine however, users may specify the exact engine in the engine parameter.\nInstance Types You may optionally specify the instance types to be used in a context. This can be a specific type such as r5.2xlarge or it can be an instance family such as c5 or a combination. By default, a context will use instance types up to 4xlarge\n Note, if you only specify large instance types you will be using those instances for running even the smallest tasks so we recommend including smaller types as well.\n Ensure that any custom types you list are available in the region that you’re using with Amazon Genomics CLI or the context will fail to deploy. You can obtain a list using the following command\naws ec2 describe-instance-type-offerings \\  --region \u003cregion_name\u003e Examples The following snippet defines two contexts, one that uses spot resources and one that uses on demand. Both contain a WDL engine.\n...contexts:# The on demand context uses on demand EC2 instances which may be more expensive but will not be interruptedonDemandCtx:requestSpotInstances:falseengines:- type:wdlengine:cromwell# The spot context uses EC2 spot instances which are usually cheaper but may be interruptedspotCtx:requestSpotInstances:trueengines:- type:wdlengine:cromwell...The following context may use any instance type from the m5, c5 or r5 families\ncontexts:nfLargeCtx:instanceTypes:[\"c5\",\"m5\",\"r5\"]engines:- type:nextflowengine:nextflowContext Commands A full reference of context commands is here\ndescribe The command agc context describe \u003ccontext-name\u003e [flags] will describe the named context as defined in the project YAML as well as other relevant account information.\nlist The command agc context list [flags] will list the names of all contexts defined in the project YAML file\ndeploy The command agc context deploy -c \u003ccontext-name\u003e [flags] is used to deploy the cloud infrastructure required by the context. If the context is already running the existing infrastructure will be updated to reflect changes in project YAML. For example if you added another data definition in your project and run agc context deploy -c \u003ccontext-name\u003e then the deployed context will be updated to allow access to the new data.\nAll contexts defined in the project YAML can be deployed or updated using the --all flag.\nIndividually named contexts can be deployed or updated as positional arguments. For example: acg context deploy -c ctx1 -c ctx2 will deploy the contexts ctx1 and ctx2.\nThe inclusion of the --verbose flag will show the full CloudFormation output of the context deployment.\ndestroy A contexts cloud resources can be “destroyed” using the agc context destroy -c \u003ccontext-name\u003e command. This will remove any infrastructure artifacts associated with the context unless they are defined as being retained. Typically, things like logs and workflow outputs on S3 are retained when a context is destroyed.\nAll deployed contexts can be destroyed using the --all flag.\nMultiple contexts can be destroyed in a single command using positional arguments. For example: acg context destroy -c ctx1 -c ctx2 will destroy the contexts ctx1 and ctx2.\nstatus The status command is used to determine the status of a deployed context or context instance. This can be useful to determine if an instance of a particular context is already deployed. It can be used to determine if the deployed context is consistent with the defined context in the project YAML file. For example, if you deploy a context instance and later change the definition of the context in the project YAML file then the running instance will no longer reflect the definition. In this case you may choose to update the deployed instance using the agc context deploy command.\nStatus will only be shown for contexts for the current user in the current AWS region for the current project. To show contexts for another project, issue the command from that project’s home folder (or subfolder). To display contexts for another AWS region, you can use a different AWS CLI profile or set the AWS_PROFILE environment variable to the desired region (e.g export AWS_REGION=us-west-2).\nWarning Because the status command will only show contexts that are listed in the project YAML you should take care to destroy any running contexts before deleting them from the project YAML.  Costs Infrastructure deployed for a context is tagged with the context name as well as username and project name. These tags can be used with AWS CostExplorer to identify the costs associated with running contexts.\nA deployed context will incur charges based on the resources being used by the context. If a workflow is running this will include compute costs for running the workflow tasks but some contexts may include infrastructure that is always “on” and will incur costs even when no workflow is running. If you no longer need a context we recommend pausing or destroying it.\nIf requestSpotInstances is true, the context will use spot instances for compute tasks. The context will set the max price to 100% although if the current price is lower you will pay the lower price. Note that even at 100% spot instances can still be interrupted if total demand for on demand instances in an availability zone exceeds the available pool. For full details see Spot Instance Interruptions and EC2 Spot Pricing.\nTags All context infrastructure is tagged with the context name, username and project name. These tags may be used to help differentiate costs.\nTechnical Details Context infrastructure is defined as code as AWS CDK apps. For examples, take a look at the packages/cdk folder. When deployed a context will produce one or more stacks in Cloudformation. Details can be viewed in the Cloudformation console or with the AWS CLI.\nA context includes an endpoint compliant with the GA4GH WES API. This API is how Amazon Genomics CLI submits workflows to the context. The context also contains one or more workflow engines. These may either be deployed as long-running services as is the case with Cromwell or as “head” jobs that are responsible for a single workflow, as is the case for NextFlow. Engines run as “head” jobs are started and stopped on demand thereby saving resources.\nUpdating Launch Templates Changes to EC2 LaunchTemplates in CDK result in a new LaunchTemplate version when the infrastructure is updated. Currently, CDK is unable to also update the default version of the template. In addition, any existing AWS Batch Compute Environments will not be updated to use the new LaunchTemplate version. Because of this, whenever a LaunchTemplate is updated in CDK code we recommend destroying any relevant running contexts and redeploying them. An update will NOT be sufficient.\n","categories":"","description":"Contexts are the set of cloud resources used to run a workflow\n","excerpt":"Contexts are the set of cloud resources used to run a workflow\n","ref":"/amazon-genomics-cli/docs/concepts/contexts/","tags":"","title":"Contexts"},{"body":"CDK Bootstrap Amazon Genomics CLI uses AWS CDK to deploy infrastructure.

This will take ~5min to complete. You only need to do this once per account region.\nThe DynamoDB table is used by the CLI for persistent state. The S3 bucket is used for durable workflow data and Amazon Genomics CLI metadata and the VPC is used to isolate compute resources. You can specify your own preexisting S3 Bucket or VPC if needed using --bucket and --vpc options.\nDefine a username Amazon Genomics CLI requires that you define a username and email. You can do this using the following command:\nagc configure email you@youremail.com\nThe username only needs to be configured once per computer that you use Amazon Genomics CLI from.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"CDK Bootstrap Amazon Genomics CLI uses AWS CDK to deploy …","ref":"/amazon-genomics-cli/docs/getting-started/setup/","tags":"","title":"Setup"},{"body":"To run an analysis you need data. In the agc-project.yaml file of an Amazon Genomics CLI project data is a list of data locations which can be used by the contexts of the project.\nIn the example data definition below we are declaring that the project’s contexts will be allowed to access the three listed S3 bucket URIs.\ndata:- location:s3://gatk-test-datareadOnly:true- location:s3://broad-referencesreadOnly:true- location:s3://1000genomes-dragen-3.7.6readOnly:trueThe contexts of the project will be denied access to all other S3 location except for the S3 bucket created or associated when the account was initialized by Amazon Genomics CLI.\nDeclaring access in the project will only ensure your infrastructure is correctly configured to access the bucket. If the target bucket is further restricted, such as by an access control list or bucket policy, you will still be denied access. In these cases you should work with the bucket owner to facilitate access.\nRead and Write The default value of readOnly is true. At the time of writing, write access is not supported (except for the Amazon Genomics CLI core S3 bucket)\nAccess to a Prefix The above examples will grant read access to an entire bucket. You can grant more granular access to a prefix within a bucket, for example:\ndata:- location:s3://my-bucket/my/prefix/Cross Account Access A bucket in another AWS account can be accessed if the owner has set up access, and you are using a role that is allowed access. See cross account access for details.\nUpdating Data Sources If data definitions are added to or removed from a project definition the change will not be reflected in deployed contexts until they are updated. This can be done with agc context deploy --all for all contexts or by using a context name to update only one. See context deploy for details.\nWarning Removing access to S3 buckets while there are running workflows in a project may cause the workflow to fail if it depends on access to data in those buckets.  Technical Details When a context is deployed, IAM roles used by the infrastructure of the context will be granted s3 permissions to perform some S3 read (or read and write) actions on the listed locations. The permissions are defined in CDK code in /packages/cdk/apps/. The CDK code does not modify any data in the buckets or any other bucket policies or configurations.\n","categories":"","description":"Data sets\n","excerpt":"Data sets\n","ref":"/amazon-genomics-cli/docs/concepts/data/","tags":"","title":"Data"},{"body":"When you install Amazon Genomics CLI it will create a folder named agc.

You have just run your first workflow in the cloud using Amazon Genomics CLI! At this point you can run additional workflows, including submitting several instances of the “hello world” workflow. The elastic compute resources will expand and contract as necessary to accommodate the backlog of submitted workflows.\nReviewing the Results Workflow results are written to an S3 bucket specified or created by Amazon Genomics CLI during account activation. You can list or retrieve the S3 URI for the bucket with:\nAGC_BUCKET=$(aws ssm get-parameter \\  --name /agc/_common/bucket \\  --query 'Parameter.Value' \\  --output text) and then use aws s3 commands to explore and retrieve data from the bucket.

If Amazon Genomics CLI created a VPC as part of the activate process, it will be removed. If Amazon Genomics CLI created an S3 bucket for you, it will be retained.\nTo uninstall Amazon Genomics CLI from your local machine, run the following command:\n./agc/uninstall.sh Note uninstalling the CLI will not remove any resources or persistent data from your AWS account.\nNext Steps  Familiarize yourself with Amazon Genomics CLI Concepts Try some tutorials  ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"When you install Amazon Genomics CLI it will create a folder named …","ref":"/amazon-genomics-cli/docs/getting-started/helloworld/","tags":"","title":"Hello world"},{"body":"A Workflow is a series of steps or tasks to be executed as part of an analysis. To run a workflow using Amazon Genomics CLI, first you must have deployed a context with suitable compute resources and with a workflow engine that can interpret the language of the workflow.\nSpecification in Project YAML In an Amazon Genomics CLI project you can specify multiple workflows in a YAML map. The following example defines four WDL version 1.0 workflows. The sourceURL property defines the location of the workflow file. If the location is relative then the relevant file is assumed to be relative to the location of the project YAML file. Absolute file locations are also possible although this may reduce the portability of a project if it is intended to be shared. Web URLS are supported as locations of the workflow definition file.\nAt this time Amazon Genomics CLI does not resolve path aliases so, for example, a sourceURL like ~/workflows/worklfow.wdl is not supported.\nThe type object declares the language of the workflow (eg, wdl, nextflow etc). The run a workflow there must be a deployed context with a matching language. The version property refers to the workflow language version.\nworkflows:hello:type:language:wdlversion:1.0sourceURL:workflows/hello.wdlread:type:language:wdlversion:1.0sourceURL:workflows/read.wdlhaplotype:type:language:wdlversion:1.0sourceURL:workflows/haplotypecaller-gvcf-gatk4.wdlwords-with-vowels:type:language:wdlversion:1.0sourceURL:workflows/words-with-vowels.wdlMulti-file Workflows Some workflow languages allow for the import of other workflows. To accommodate this, Amazon Genomics CLI supports using a directory as a source URL. When a directory is supplied as the sourceURL, Amazon Genomics CLI uses the following rules to determine the name of the main workflow file and any supporting files:\n If the source URL resolves to a single non-zipped file, then the file is assumed to be a workflow file. Dependent resources (if any) are hardcoded in the file and must be resolvable by the Wes adapter or implicitly the workflow engine (e.g the Wes adapter figures out if the engine can resolve them and if not it resolves them itself). The source URL resolves to a zipped file (.zip). The zip may contain a manifest.  If the zip file does not contain a file named MANIFEST.json:  The zip file must contain one workflow file with the prefix main followed by the conventional suffix for the workflow, e.g. main.wdl Any subworkflows or tasks referenced by the main workflow must either be in the zip at the appropriate relative path or they must be referenced by URLs that are resolvable by the workflow engine. The WesAdapter may attempt to resolve them for the engine but this is a convenience and not required. Any variables not defined in the workflows must be provided in an inputs file named with the prefix inputs and the conventional suffix for the workflow engine (e.g inputs.json). For workflow engines that support multiple input files an index suffix must be provided (e.g. inputs_a.json or inputs_1.json) if there is more than one inputs file. A workflow options file may be included and must be named with the options prefix followed by the conventional suffix of the workflow. The WesAdapter may chose to make use of this depending on the context of the workflow engine. It may also choose to pass this to the workflow engine or pass a modified copy to the workflow engine.   If the zip file does contain a manifest:  The manifest must contain a parameter called mainWorkflowURL. If it does then the value of the parameter must either be a URL or the name of a file present in the zip archive. Any subworkflows or tasks imported by the main workflow must either be referenced as URLs in the workflow or be present in the archive as described above. The manifest may contain an array of URLs to inputs files called inputFileURLs. The WesAdapter must decide if it should resolve these or let the workflow engine resolve them. The manifest may contain a URL reference to an options files name optionFileURL. The WesAdapter may chose to make use of this depending on the context of the workflow engine. It may also choose to pass this to the workflow engine or pass a modified copy to the workflow engine.      The following snippet demonstrates the declaration of a mutlifile workflow:\nworkflows:gatk4-data-processing:type:langauge:wdlversion:1.0sourceURL:./gatk4-data-processingThe following snippet demonstrates a valid MANIFEST.json file:\n{ \"mainWorkflowURL\": \"processing-for-variant-discovery-gatk4.wdl\", \"inputFileURLs\": [ \"processing-for-variant-discovery-gatk4.hg38.wgs.inputs.json\" ], \"optionFileURL\": \"options.json\" } Engine Selection When a workflow is submitted to run, Amazon Genomics CLI will match the workflow type with the map of engines in the context. For example, if the workflow type is wdl Amazon Genomics CLI will attempt to identify and engine designated as the engine for that type. There may only be one engine per type. If no suitable engine is found in the context an error will be reported.\nWorkflow Instances Any defined project workflow can be run multiple times. Each run is called an instance and assigned a unique instance ID. When referring to a specific run of a workflow you should use the instance ID rather than the workflow name. It is possible to submit multiple instances of the same workflow and to have these run concurrently.\nContext All workflows are coordinated by the engine, they are submitted to and executed in the context that is specified at submission time. The workflow engine decides how the workflow is to be run and the context provides compute resources to run the workflow.\nCommands A full reference of workflow commands is available here\nrun Invoking agc workflow run \u003cworkflow-name\u003e -c \u003ccontext-name\u003e will run the named workflow in a specific context. The unique ID of that workflow instance run will be returned if the submission is successful.\nworkflow arguments Workflow arguments such as options files can be specified at submission time using the a or --args flag. For example:\nagc workflow run my-workflow --args inputs.json If the inputs file references local files, these will be synced with S3 and those files in S3 will be used when the workflow instance is run.\nlist The agc workflow list command can be used to list all workflows that are specified in the current project.\ndescribe The agc workflow describe \u003cworkflow-name\u003e command will return detailed information about the named workflow based on the specification in the current project YAML file.\nstatus To find out the status of workflow instances that are running, or have been run you can use the agc workflow status command. This will display details on 20 recent workflows from the project, to display more, or fewer you can use the --limit number flag where the number may be as many as 1000.\nTo list the status of workflows run or running in a specific context use the --context-name flag and provide the name of one of the contexts of the project.\nYou may get the status of workflow instances by workflow name using the --workflow-name flag.\nTo display the status of a specific workflow instance you can provide the id of the desired workflow instance with the --instance-id flag.\nstop A running workflow instance can be stopped at any time using the agc workflow stop \u003cinstance-id\u003e command. When issued, Amazon Genomics CLI will look up the appropriate context and engine using the instance-id of the workflow and instruct the engine to stop the workflow. What happens next depends on the actual workflow engine. For example, in the case of the Cromwell WDL engine, any currently executing tasks will halt, any pending tasks will be removed from the work queue and no further tasks will be started for that workflow instance.\nCost Your account will be charged based on actual resource usage including compute time, storage, data transfer charges etc. The resources used will depend on the resources requested in your workflow definition as interpreted by the workflow engine according the resources made available in the context in which the workflow is run. If a spot context is used then the costs of the spot instances will be determined by the rules governing spot instance charges.\nTags Resources used by Amazon Genomics CLI are tagged including the username, project name and the context name. Currently, tagging is not possible at the level of an individual workflow.\n","categories":"","description":"A Workflow is a series of steps or tasks to be executed as part of an analysis.\n","excerpt":"A Workflow is a series of steps or tasks to be executed as part of an …","ref":"/amazon-genomics-cli/docs/concepts/workflows/","tags":"","title":"Workflows"},{"body":"A workflow engine is defined as part of a context. A context is currently limited to one workflow engine. The workflow engine will manage the execution of any workflows submitted by Amazon Genomics CLI. When the context is deployed, an endpoint will be made available to Amazon Genomics CLI through which it will submit workflows and workflow commands to the engine according to the WES API specification.\nSupported Engines and Workflow Languages Currently, Amazon Genomics CLI’s officially supported engines can be used to run the following workflows:\n   Engine Language Language Versions     Cromwell WDL All versions up to 1.0   Nextflow Nextflow DSL Standard and DSL 2    Overtime we plan to add additional engine and language support and provide the ability for third party developers to develop engine plugins.\nEngine Definition An engine is defined within a context definition of the project YAML file file as a map. For example, the following snippet defines a WDL engine of type cromwell as part of the context named onDemandCtx. There may be one engine defined for each supported language.\ncontexts:onDemandCtx:requestSpotInstances:falseengines:- type:wdlengine:cromwellCommands There are no commands specific to engines. Engines are deployed along with contexts by the context commands and workflows are run using the workflow commands.\nCosts The costs associated with an engine depend on the actual infrastructure required by the engine. In the case of the Cromwell, the engine runs in “server” mode as an AWS ECS Fargate container using an Amazon Elastic File System for metadata storage. The container will be running for the entire time the context is deployed, even when no workflows are running. To avoid this cost we recommend destroying the context when it is not needed. The Nextflow engine runs as a single batch job per workflow instance and is only running when workflows are running.\nIn both cases a serverless WES API endpoint is deployed through Amazon API Gateway to act as the interface between Amazon Genomics CLI and the engine.\nTags Being part of a context, engine related infrastructure is tagged with the context name, username and project name. These tags may be used to help differentiate costs.\nTechnical Details Supported engines are currently deployed with configurations that allow them to make use of files in S3 and submit workflows as jobs to AWS Batch. Because the current generation of engines we support do not directly support the WES API, adapters are deployed as Fargate container tasks. AWS API Gateway is used to provide a gateway between Amazon Genomics CLI and the WES adapters.\nWhen workflow commands are issued on Amazon Genomics CLI, it will send WES API calls to the appropriate endpoint. The adapter mapped to that endpoint will then translate the WES command and either send the command to the engines REST API for Cromwell, or spawn a Nextflow engine task and submit the workflow with that task. At this point the engine is responsible for creating controlling and destroying the resources that will be used for task execution.\n","categories":"","description":"Workflow engines parse and manage the tasks in a workflow\n","excerpt":"Workflow engines parse and manage the tasks in a workflow\n","ref":"/amazon-genomics-cli/docs/concepts/engines/","tags":"","title":"Engines"},{"body":"The infrastructure deployed by Amazon Genomics CLI records logs for many activities including the workflow runs, workflow engines as well as infrastructure. The logs are recorded in CloudWatch but are accessible through the CLI.\nWhen debugging or reviewing a workflow run, the engine logs and workflow logs will be the most useful. For diagnosing infrastructure or access problems the adapter logs and access logs will be informative.\nEngine Logs Engine logs are the logs produced by a workflow engine in a context. The logs produced depend on the engine implementation. Engines that run in “server” mode, such as Cromwell, produce a single log for the lifetime of the context that encompass all workflows run through that engine. Engines that run as “head node” will produce discrete engine logs for each run.\nWorkflow Logs Workflow logs are the aggregate logs for all steps in a workflow run (instance). Any workflow steps that are retrieved from a call cache are not run so there will be no workflow logs for these steps. Consulting the engine logs may show details of the call cache. If a previously successful workflow is run with no changes in inputs or parameters it may have all steps retrieved from the cache in which case there will be no workflow logs although the workflow instance will be marked as a success and engine logs will be produced. The outputs for a completely cached workflow will also be available.\nAdapter Logs Adapter logs consist of any logs produced by a WES adapter for a workflow engine. They can reveal information such as the WES API calls that are made to the engine by Amazon Genomics CLI and any errors that may have occurred.\nAccess Logs Amazon Genomics CLI talks to an engine via API Gateway which routes to the WES adapter. If an expected call does not appear in the adapter logs it may have been blocked or incorrectly routed in the API Gateway. The API Gateway access logs may be informative in this case.\nCommands A full reference of Amazon Genomics CLI logs commands are available here\nCosts Amazon Genomics CLI logs are stored in CloudWatch and accessed using the CloudWatch APIs. Standard CloudWatch charges apply. All logs are retained permanently, even after a context is destroyed and other Amazon Genomics CLI infrastructure is removed from an account. If they are no longer needed they may be removed using the AWS Console or the AWS CLI.\n","categories":"","description":"Logs are produced by contexts, engines and workflow tasks.

We recommend you use this tool to gain sight into the costs of running your genomics workflows. At the time of writing AWS Cost Explorer can only be enabled using the AWS Console so Amazon Genomics CLI won’t be able to set this up for you. As a first step you will need to enable cost explorer for your AWS account.\nAmazon Genomics CLI will tag the infrastructure it creates with tags. Application, user, project and context tags are all generated as appropriate and these can be used as cost allocation tags to determine which account costs are coming from Amazon Genomics CLI and which user, context and project.\nWithin Cost Explorer the Amazon Genomics CLI tags will be referred to as “User Defined Cost Allocation Tags”. Before a tag can be used in a cost report it must be activated. Costs associated with tags are only available for infrastructure used after activation of a tag, so it will not be possible to retrospectively examine costs.\nOptimizing Requested Container Resources Tasks in a workflow typically run in Docker containers. Depending on the workflow language there will be some kind of runtime definition that specifies the number of vCPUs and amount of RAM allocated to the task. For example, in WDL you could specify\n runtime { docker: \"biocontainers/plink1.9:v1.90b6.6-181012-1-deb_cv1\" memory: \"8 GB\" cpu: 2 } The amount of resource allocated to each container ultimately impacts the cost to run a workflow. Optimally allocating resources leads to cost efficiency.\nOptimize the longest running, and most parallel tasks first When optimizing a workflow, focus on those tasks that run the longest as well as those that have the largest number of parallel tasks as they will make up the majority of the workflow runtime and contribute most to the cost.\nConsider CPU and memory ratios EC2 workers for Cromwell AWS Batch compute environments are c, m, and r instance families that have vCPU to memory ratios of 1:2, 1:4 and 1:8 respectively. Engines that run container based workflows will typically attempt to fit containers to instances in the most optimal way depending on cost and size requirements, or they will delegate this to a service like AWS Batch. Given that a task requiring 16GB of RAM that could make use of all available CPUs, then to optimally pack the containers you should specify either 2, 4, or 8 vCPU. Other values could lead to inefficient packing meaning the resources of the EC2 container instance will be paid for but not optimally used.\n NOTE: Fully packing an instance can result in it becoming unresponsive if the tasks in the containers use 100% (or more if they start swapping) of the allocated resources. The instance may then be unresponsive to its management services or the workflow engine and may time out. To avoid this, always allow for a little overhead, especially in the smaller instances.\n The largest instance types deployed by default are from the 4xlarge size which have 16 vCPU and up to 128 MB of RAM.\nConsider splitting tasks that pipe output If a workflow task consists of a process that pipes STDOUT to another process then both processes will run in the same container and receive the same resources. If one task requires more resources than the other this might be inefficient, it may be better divided into two tasks each with its own runtime configuration. Note that this will require the intermediate STDOUT to be written to a file and copied between containers so if this output is very large then keeping the processes in the same task may be more efficient. Piping very large outputs may a lot of memory so your container will need an appropriate allocation of memory.\nUse the most cost-effective instance generation When you specify the instanceTypes in a context, as opposed to letting Amazon Genomics CLI do it for you, consider the cost and performance of the instance types with respect to your workflow requirements. Fifth generation EC2 types (c5, m5, r5) have a lower on-demand price and have higher clock speeds than their 4th generation counterparts (c4, m4, r4). Therefore, for on-demand compute environments, those instance types should be preferred. In spot compute environments we suggest using both 4th and 5th generation types as this increases the pool of available types meaning Batch will be able to choose the instance type that is cheapest and least likely to be interrupted.\nDeploy Amazon Genomics CLI where your S3 data is Genomics workflows may need to access considerable amounts of data stored in S3. Although S3 uses global namespaces, buckets do reside in regions. If you access a lot of S3 data it makes sense to deploy your Amazon Genomics CLI infrastructure in the same region to avoid cross region data charges.\nFurther, if you use a custom VPC we recommend deploying a VPC endpoint for S3 so that you do no incur NAT Gateway charges for data coming from the same region. If you do not you might find that NAT Gateway charges are the largest part of your workflow run costs. If you allow Amazon Genomics CLI to create your VPC (the default), appropriate VPC endpoints will be setup for you. Note that VPC endpoints cannot avoid cross region data charges, so you will still want to deploy in the region where most of your data resides.\nUse Spot Instances The use of Spot instances can significantly reduce costs of running workflows. However, spot instances may be interrupted when EC2 demand is high. Some workflow engines, such as Cromwell, can support retries of tasks that fail due to Spot interruption (among other things). To enable this for Cromwell, include the awsBatchRetryAttempts parameter in the runtime section of a WDL task with an integer number of attempts.\nEven with retries, there is a risk that spot interruption will case a task or entire workflow to fail. Use of an engines call caching capabilities (if available) can help avoid repeating work if a partially complete workflow needs to be restarted du to Spot instance interruption.\nUse private ECR registries Each task in a workflow requires access to a container image, and some of these images can be several GB if they contain large packages like GATK. This can lead to large NAT Gateway traffic charges. To avoid these charges, we recommend deploying copies of frequently used container images into your accounts private ECR registry.\nAmazon Genomics CLI deployed VPCs use a VPC gateway to talk to private ECR registries in your account thereby avoiding NAT Gateway traffic. The gateway is limited to registries in the same region as the VPC, so to avoid cross-region traffic you should deploy images into the region(s) that you use for Amazon Genomics CLI.\n","categories":"","description":"Monitoring costs and design considerations to reduce costs\n","excerpt":"Monitoring costs and design considerations to reduce costs\n","ref":"/amazon-genomics-cli/docs/best-practices/controllingcosts/","tags":"","title":"Controlling Costs"},{"body":"Workflows with considerable compute requirements can incur large costs and may fail due to infrastructure constraints. The following considerations will help you design workflows that will perform better at scale.\nLarge compute requirements By default, contexts created by AGC will allocate compute nodes with a size of up to 4xlarge. These types have 16 vCPU and up to 128 GB of RAM. If an individual task requires additional resources you may specify these in the instanceTypes array of the project context. For example:\ncontexts:prod:requestSpotInstances:falseinstanceTypes:- c5.16xlarge- r5.24xlargeLarge data growth When using the Nextflow or Cromwell engines the EC2 container instances that carry out the work use a script to detect and automatically expand disk capacity. Generally, this will allow disk space to increase to the amount required to hold inputs, scratch and outputs. However, it can take up to a minute to attach new storage so events that fill disk space in under a minute can result in failure.\nLarge numbers of inputs/ outputs Typically, genomics files are large and best stored in S3. However, most applications used in genomics workflows cannot read directly from S3. Therefore, these inputs must be localized from S3. Compute work will not be able to begin until localization is complete so “divide and conquer” strategies are useful in these cases.\nWhenever possible compress inputs (and outputs) appropriately. The CPU overhead of compression will be low compared to the network overhead of localization and delocalization.\nLocalization of large numbers of large files from S3 will put load on the network interface of the worker nodes and the node may experience transient network failures or S3 throttling. While we have included retry-with-backoff logic for localization it is not impossible that downloads may occasionally fail. Failures (and retries) will be recorded in the workflow task logs.\nParallel Steps Workflows often contain parallel steps where many individual tasks are computed in parallel. Amazon Genomics CLI makes use of elastic compute clusters to scale to these requirements. Each context will deploy an elastic compute cluster with a minimum of 0 vCPU and a maximum of 256 vCPU. No individual task may use more than 256 vCPU. Smaller tasks may be run in parallel up to the maximum of 256 vCPU. Once that limit is met, additional tasks will be queued to run when capacity becomes free.\nEach parallel task is isolated meaning each task will need a local copy of its inputs. When large numbers of parallel tasks, require the same inputs (for example reference genomes) you may observe contention for network resources and transient S3 failures. While we have included retry with backoff logic we recommend keeping the number of parallel tasks requiring the same inputs below 500. Fewer, if the tasks inputs are large.\nAn extreme example is Joint Genotyping. This type of analysis benefits from processing large numbers of samples at the same. Further, the user may wish to genotype many intervals concurrently. Finally, the step of merging the variant calls will import the variants from all intervals. In our experience, a naive implementation calling 100 samples over 100 intervals is feasible. Also, feasible is calling ~20 samples over 500 intervals. At larger scales it would be worth considering dividing tasks by chromosome or batching inputs.\nContainer throttling Some container registries will throttle container access from anonymous accounts. Because each task in a workflow uses a container large or frequently run workflows may not be able to access their required containers. While compute clusters deployed by Amazon Genomics CLI are configured to cache containers this is only available on a per-instance basis. Further, due to the elastic nature of the clusters instances with cached container images are frequently shutdown. All of this will potentially lead to an excess of requests. To avoid this we recommend using registries that don’t impose these limits, or using images hosted in an ECR registry in your AWS account.\n","categories":"","description":"Making workflows run at scale\n","excerpt":"Making workflows run at scale\n","ref":"/amazon-genomics-cli/docs/best-practices/scalingworkloads/","tags":"","title":"Scaling Workloads"},{"body":"  #td-cover-block-0 { background-image: url(/amazon-genomics-cli/about/featured-background_hu36ffe3fa6b0c816f6ba2df4cf63a0de9_827511_960x540_fill_catmullrom_bottom_2.png); } @media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) { #td-cover-block-0 { background-image: url(/amazon-genomics-cli/about/featured-background_hu36ffe3fa6b0c816f6ba2df4cf63a0de9_827511_1920x1080_fill_catmullrom_bottom_2.png); } }  About Amazon Genomics CLI        Amazon Genomics CLI is an open-source command line tool developed by the AWS Health AI team to simplify running genomics workflows in the cloud.\nAmazon Genomics CLI takes care of deploying and managing the cloud infrastructure required to run workflows in common bioinformatics workflow languages such as WDL and Nextflow DSL allowing you to focus on analytics and workflow development.\n   ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"  #td-cover-block-0 { background-image: …","ref":"/amazon-genomics-cli/about/","tags":"","title":"About Amazon Genomics CLI"},{"body":"  #td-cover-block-0 { background-image: url(/amazon-genomics-cli/featured-background_hu3ae7ffd98b04523d152891e92ce13091_1053589_960x540_fill_catmullrom_top_2.png); } @media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) { #td-cover-block-0 { background-image: url(/amazon-genomics-cli/featured-background_hu3ae7ffd98b04523d152891e92ce13091_1053589_1920x1080_fill_catmullrom_top_2.png); } }  Welcome to the Amazon Genomics CLI Learn More   Download   Simplifying genomics workflows in the cloud!\n         Amazon Genomics CLI is an open source CLI that helps customers run genomics workflows in the cloud by automating deployment of best practices infrastructure for workflow engines.
